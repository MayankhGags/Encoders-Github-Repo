    Well those of you who use social media on a daily basis may already know the meaning of this 
and many of you don’t. I know what you’re thinking---what in the world is “rizz”? Well well,  
RIZZ is actually a new slang term that has taken over the internet like wildfire, this word was 
popularized by the twitch streamer KAI CENATI in 2021. So YES, what is RIZZ ? it is basically 
short for ‘charisma’! But it’s not just any kind of charisma; it specifically refers to someone’s 
natural charm or perhaps their ability to attract others, particularly in a romantic or flirtatious 
context maybe it’s the factor that makes people hang out with you. 
For a moment, imagine someone who walks into a room and instantly captivates everyone with 
their smooth talk, confidence, and sparkly remarks—that person is said to have “rizz.” It’s that 
magnetic quality that makes others take notice, smile, or even collapse. In today’s world, being 
told you have "rizz" is quite the compliment!  
And to frame it in a sentence,  
“Despite being new to the school, *ENTER NAME* has so much rizz that he quickly became the 
most popular guy in the class.” 
That’s it, Thank you everyone for giving their time and the next time you see someone who 
effortlessly wins over people, remember they’ve got the RIZZ.
